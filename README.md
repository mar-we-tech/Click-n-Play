#**Randomizer Generator League of Legends Website**

Welcome to my **Randomizer Generator for League of Legends Project** that includes lanes, roles and items etc.! 🎉  
I'm building a **website** for a **fast, practical, and visually appealing Randomizer for League of Legends**. 🧑‍💻💡

## 🚀 **What is the Randomizer Generator?**

The **Randomizer Generator** is a website that allows you to generate random champions, roles, runes, or items etc. 🔀  
Whether you're playing a game, needing the trollness in the game (no ranked games!), or just need a random choice – this generator will help you! 🕹️🎯

### 🏆 **Goal: Focus: Visual UI & User-Friendliness**

- **Visually appealing**: The interface will be clean and modern, allowing you to make a random choice with just a few clicks. 👀✨
- **Practical**: The generator will be optimized to deliver fast results. ⚡💨
- **Fast**: With quick load times, the generator ensures you never have to wait long. ⏱️🚀

## 🔧 **Goal: Features & Highlights**

- **Random selection from lists**: You can easily click on the element (in that case buttons, icons etc.) one which you want to be randomize, and the generator will randomize it. 📋➡️🎲
- **Simple and fast**: No complicated setup! Just click your desires, and the randomizer does the rest! 🔄⚡

## 👨‍💻 **Technologies & Tools**

This website will be built using the typically following technologies:

- **HTML** for the structure 🏗️
- **CSS** for design and styling 🎨
- **JavaScript** for the logic and functionality ⚙️
- **Netlify** for hosting the website 🌐 (or GitHub page)

## 🔄 **(MAYBE) Future Features**

- **Mobile-friendly**: Optimization for mobile devices 📱
- **API Integration**: An API that allows you to use the randomizer in other projects 🔌
- **Custom Themes**: The ability to customize the website's design 🎨✨
- **Donating:** A way to donate me or for this website 💡


**IT'S NOT FINISHED!!**
